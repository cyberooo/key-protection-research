# Welcome to the artifacts for the paper "A Longitudinal Study of Android Apps Signing Key Protection"

## This repository is used for anonymous peer review.

There are three folders in this repository:
* source_code: The Python source code used for searching keystore files on GitHub, as well as the password extraction.
* sample_data: The results of keystore exploration and signature extraction from real-world apps.
* demo_video: Some technical details about our POC attack, together with the demo video.

## You can navigate to the specific folder to see more details. Each folder has a dedicated README file.

## Please note that due to ethical considerations, we cannot fully open-source the complete keystore results and the implementation of the POC attack. Instead, we uploaded the necessary technical details to prove the authenticity of our project. Thanks for your understanding.
